# Description
This repository contains my work for the 2024 edition of Google ARM summer school.
# Goals of the summer school
This year's edition aimed to teach us:
- the ARM boot process; 
- how to bootstrap Linux on ARM platforms;
- how the TEE works on ARM;
- building trusted execution apps;
- kernel programming and how to write a kernel module;
- how to write device drivers;

To achieve our goals we had both lectures where our mentors explained the day's topic to us and after that labs where we applied the new knowledge on Tech Nexion PICO PI iMX8M SBCs.
# What is in the repository
I've included my work over the course of the summers school, the Makefile, all the modules (some of which have custom configurations, linux being forked and modified), and some build files (bad practice, but there wasn't much time for a .gitignore). Sadly most of the work also involved interacting with the board, like rewriting the eMMC and so  on and I cannot include that.
# I also want to learn this! Where do I start?

Shoutout and special thanks to our mentors, Florin Stancu and Radu Mantu for their constant support and for making this summer school an awesome experience I would definitely repeat!
